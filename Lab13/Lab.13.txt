	Alice and Bob wish to communicate with each other over the Internet. Each uses RSA, the common asymmetric cryptography protocol.
Thus, each has his/her own private key and knows the public key of the other. 
Let us denote private key of Alice as Pr(A), private key of Bob as Pr(B), public key of Alice as Pu(A), and public key of Bob as Pu(B). 

Please use the following notation in presenting your answers:
E_K (M): Message M is encrypted using key K
D_K (M): Message M is decrypted using key K

	Alice wants to send a message to Bob so that no one else can read it. Let us denote the message as M_1. 

	How would Alice send the message? 
	
	Answer: Alice would first use a cipher to create an encoded message. Thanks to this the message will be encrypted.
	Her message would be encrypted using Bobs public key so the messege would be: E_Pu(B) (M_1) 	

	Let us denote the message Alice sent as M_3. How would Bob decipher the message?

	Answer: Bob would have to use his private key to decipher M_3. If Bob receives the encrypted message M_3 as: E_Pu(B) (M_3)
	Bob will have to decrypt: D_Pr(B) (E_Pu(B) (M_3))
	After decrypting Bob will be able to view the original M_3 message that Alice sent.

	In this situation, Alice does not care if anyone can read her message. 
	But she does care that no one in the middle can change the message (in an undetectable manner). Let us denote the message as M_2.
	
	How would Alice send the message?	

	Answer: Alice would have to use a digital signature.
	To do this Alice can use a hash function such as MD5.
	h = hash(m_2)
	To sign this message Alice computes a difes and then encrypts it using her private key Pr(A).

	What would Bob do to verify that the message indeed came from Alice?	

	Answer: Bob can verify that the message came from Alice by verifying the digital signature that was sent with the message.
	Bob will have to decrypt the digest from Alice and then calculate the digest of received data.
